Shaker is an asset rollup management tool for Mojito applications that improves performance
by reducing the number of HTTP requests. 

A rollup consists of one or more input files that are combined (rolled up) to produce a 
single output file. Rollups can be as simple as a single file, a single mojit binder and 
its dependencies, or any combination thereof.

Shaker allows you to create rollups using different combination of dimensions. A dimension
can represent a runtime or regional environment. For example, you may want to serve 
different assets when people are connected from different devices, different countries, 
etc.

Shaker is an asset rollup management tool for Mojito applications which reduces the number of HTTP requests, thus improving performance. 

A rollup consists of one or more input files that are combined (rolled up) to produce a single output file. Rollups can be as simple as a single file, a single mojit binder and its dependencies, or any combination thereof.

Shaker allows you to create rollups using different combination of dimensions. For example, you may want to serve different assets when people are connected from different devices, different countries, etc.
